# Autonomous Navigation Robot using ROS2, Nav2, and SLAM Toolbox

## Overview

This project showcases an autonomous navigation robot built using ROS2, Nav2, and SLAM Toolbox. The robot is simulated in Gazebo and visualized in RViz. The main goal of this project is to enable the robot to navigate to a target location autonomously while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot navigates to a specified goal position autonomously, avoiding obstacles in its path.
- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: Utilizes SLAM Toolbox for real-time localization and mapping.
- **Simulation in Gazebo**: The robot and environment are simulated in Gazebo.
- **Visualization in RViz**: Real-time visualization of the robot's navigation and sensor data in RViz.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- ROS2 (tested on [specific ROS2 version])
- Gazebo
- RViz
- SLAM Toolbox
- Nav2
